## Philosophy

- Work on all major operating systems
- Not platform dependent, not tied to Github, Gitlab, or anything. It's just markdown.
- Ability to generate change logs between version tags
- Handle release versioning of the project
- Stay small

## Why

Every language has it's own isolated version of a tool like this, for someone who works with multiple languages, it's easier to
have the same tool working everywhere, without having to setup something get it working. There's an even tighter scoped version of this, [nimclog](https://github.com/barelyhuman/nimclog).

The point of the tool is not to create super descriptive changelogs for you but to help your changelogs have enough information for you as a developer to be able to write proper changelogs while having references to the changes in one place.
