## Support

I'd like to keep building more such tools and do them full time instead of doing it during the weekend, help achieve that if you like the tool.

## Binaries

Binaries are available on the Github [releases](https://github.com/barelyhuman/commitlog/releases)

## Build

This step is for people who want to use the latest version from the repositories which hasn't been added to releases as a binary yet and for people viewing this on sourcehut , as the binaries aren't uploaded to sourcehut.

- Make sure you have go installed on your system , minimum version `1.15`
- You can either clone the whole repo from sourcehut / github or downlad a tar.gz from sourcehut / github

### With Clone

```sh
git clone https://git.sr.ht/~reaper/commitlog
# or
git clone https://github.com/barelyhuman/commitlog

cd commitlog
go build
```

### With Tarballs

```sh
tar -xvzf commitlog-<hash>.tar.gz
cd commitlog
go build
```

```sh
# to install it to go's bin folder and use the commitlog command during dev or as a perm install
go install
```

### Web Version

Source: [commitlog-web](https://github.com/barelyhuman/commitlog-web)

Web App: [commitlog-web](https://commitlog-web.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

The usage is pretty simple, this cli tool assumes that you use [commitlint standards](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint#what-is-commitlint) while writing your commits, if not it's okay everything will be classified under `Other Changes` instead of being grouped according to type of commit.

**Simple Overview**  
`ci: <message>` - for ci/cd changes  
`feat|feature: <message>` - for feature changes  
`docs: <message>` - for documents or comment updations in code  
`refactor: <message>` - performance / code clean up changes or total BLOC changes  
`fix: <message>` - for fixes (self-explanatory)

### Supported Flags (as of v0.0.4-dev.3)

The below mentioned are the flags supported by the current branch and older tags might not support the flags
or certain inputs in flags, use the `-h` flag to see what's supported on the version you are using.

```sh
Usage of commitlog:
  -e string
        commit hash string / revision (ex. HEAD, HEAD^, HEAD~2)
         to stop collecting commit message at
  -i string
        commit types to be includes (default "ci,refactor,docs,fix,feat,test,chore,other")
  -p string
        path to the repository, points to the current working directory by default (default ".")
  -s string
        commit hash string / revision (ex. HEAD, HEAD^, HEAD~2)
         to start collecting commit messages from
  -skip
        if true will skip trying to classify and just give a list of changes
```

### Example Output (from this exact repository)

```sh
> commitlog
# which is the shorthand of
> commitlog log -p .
```

**As of 0.0.6 there's an experimental release subcommand that can be used for version tagging**

```

## Subcommands 

#### `release` (beta / experimental)

As of **0.0.7-dev.7** the cli comes with a sub command to maintain version for the repository.

The command will
- create the `.commitlog.release` file to handle and persit the version
- handle the semver increments 
- create a new commit and tag for the same

```sh
$ commitlog release -beta -beta-suffix dev
Current Version:
v0.0.7-dev.6
New Version
0.0.7-dev.7
? Do you want me to create a commit for the new version?: Yes
âœ” Updated Version
```



## Current Limitations

- No Tests added so is probably unstable right now ( If you'd like to help writing tests, feel free to raise a PR)
- Doesn't work inside a nested folder in the repository, needs to be on the root of the repository to work. (you can use the `-p` flag to set a path to generate logs from)
