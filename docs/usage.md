# Usage

If you are looking for an overview of the flags, please check the [manual](/manual).

The base command should serve enough for most people but let's still get into the details of what can be done.

- The cli allows you to select a range which can be reference strings like (HEAD, HEAD~2) and this will give you commits in that range, exclusive of the end reference.
- classification is optional but is turned on by default and uses the inclusion types to do the classification
- You can also handle managing releases by using the `release` subcommand.
