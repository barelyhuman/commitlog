You are free to raise PR's for any kind of improvements and or feature additions, they'll be added to the repository accordingly, you can also fork up your own version as the repo will remain MIT licensed

## Dev Guidelines
- Fork the Repo
- Make your changes (use `git pull --rebase` when working with others to avoid creating un-needed merge commits )
- Raise a PR 
- Your changes will then be reviewed and merged into a test pr-#id-rebase branch for testing 
and then merged into `main` if everything goes through

## Pull Request and Commit Guidelines
- Commitlog is based off of commit standards where the commit message specifies what 
kind of commit it is, make sure your commits follow the same.
- The PR doesn't need to have detailed explanation but a small pointer of what each commit does should be fine, 
on the other hand you could use commitlog to generate the hash and changes for your PR
