## Dev Guidelines
- Fork the Repo
- Make your changes 
- Raise a PR 
- Your changes will then be reviewed and merged into a test pr-#id-rebase branch for testing 
and then merged into `main` if everything goes through

## Pull Request and Commit Guidelines
- Commitlog is based off of commit standards where the commit message specifies what 
kind of commit it is, make sure your commits follow the same.
- The PR doesn't need to have detailed explanation but a small pointer of what each commit does should be fine, 
on the other hand you could use commitlog to generate the hash and changes for your PR

Finally,  
**Maintain a healthy and friendly environment in all the threads (discussions, issue thread, PR Threads)**
