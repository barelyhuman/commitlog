<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>
<p><strong><em><code>commitlog</code></em></strong> come with 2 basic functionalities</p>
<ul>
<li>Generating commits as changelogs in markdown</li>
<li>Managing your version and tags</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the above are available as sub commands and we'll go through each one by
one.</p>
<p>Just running <code>commitlog</code> no longer works as it did in v1, you'll need to specify
a sub command to get it working.</p>
<p>This has been done to keep it simpler to keep arbitrary behaviour to a minimum</p>
<h4 id="generate">generate</h3>
<p>The first one is <code>generate</code> and in most cases you'll just be using this to
handle generation of commits as a list of markdown notes</p>
<p>Here's an example of what it'll look like to run the <code>generate</code> sub-command</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ commitlog generate
# or 
$ commitlog g
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output</strong>:</p>

&lt;!-- .... more commits till the end of tag --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The behaviour of the <code>generate</code> command is like so</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>go through all commits from the current <code>HEAD</code> (commit with the <code>HEAD</code>
reference) till the last commit or the most recent tagged commit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the other case is where if the latest commit is also a tagged commit, it'll
still go till the most recent tagged commit.</p>
<p>eg: v0.0.2 -&gt; HEAD, v0.0.1 -&gt; SOMEHASH, would give you the commits between
both the tags.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The default behaviour of <strong><em>commitlog</em></strong> is to print to the stdout of your
terminal which might not be what you wish to do.</p>
<p>So, if you wish to ever write to a file , you can use the <code>--out FILE</code> flag to
write the output to a file instead.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ commitlog g -o ./CHANGELOG.md
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: commitlog will overwrite the file with the new output, make sure you
create a backup of the file when working with this.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In coming versions an append mode will be added to the CLI to avoid
having to deal with this manually</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="release">release</h3>
<p>The <code>release</code> sub-command is a complimentary sub-command added to commitlog to
help you with managing release versions. I understand that most languages have
their own package version management and you might want to work with them but
that's also why the <code>release</code> sub-command isn't something you need, it's there
for cases where you might wanna use it.</p>
<p>My primary usecase is when working with repositories that work with multiple
languages and I'd prefer a unified version.</p>
<p>The <code>release</code> command doesn't modify your source code files but instead handles
the version with it's own file named <code>.commitlog.release</code>, which just holds the
<strong>version</strong> number right now and while this does have the X.X.X format (semantic
versioning format) the increments or how you handle them doesn't have to be.</p>
<p>The command is flexible enough for you to combine and create your own way of
versioning.</p>
<h5>Initialize</h5>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ commitlog release --init
# or 
$ commitlog r --init
</code></pre>
<p>Once initialized, you'll see a <code>.commitlog.release</code> file in your repo with the
version <code>v0.0.0</code> to start with.</p>
<h5>Increments</h5>
<p>Post that you can use the remaining flags to help you incrementing the version
as needed.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ commitlog r --major # change to v1.0.0
$ commitlog r --minor # change to v0.1.0
$ commitlog r --patch # change to v0.0.1
$ commitlog r --pre # change to v0.0.0-beta.0
$ commitlog r --pre --pre-tag=&quot;dev&quot; # change to v0.0.0-dev.0

# or go bonkers 
$ commitlog r --patch --pre --pre-tag=&quot;dev&quot; # change to v0.0.1-dev.0
$ commitlog r --major --patch --pre --pre-tag=&quot;dev&quot; # change to v1.0.1-dev.0
</code></pre>
<h4>Git actions</h4>
<p>Most times you'd also want a tool like this to create commits and tags for you
which is fair, so <code>release</code> does come with a few git actions.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--commit</code> (will create a commit and tag it for you)</li>
<li><code>--push</code> (will push the commits and tags for you)</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole command would look a little something like this</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ commitlog r --patch --commit --push
</code></pre>
<h3 id="advanced">Advanced</h3>
<p>These are not really hard to guess or achieve but are in the advanced section as
this isn't something a beginner user might need to mess with. If you have other
use cases that you feel like should be added here, raise a issue.</p>
<h4 id="selective-log-ranges">Selective Log Ranges</h4>
There's enough cases where the entire history between the tags makes no sense. You might just want a specific set of commits and this is very easy to do with commitlog
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ commitlog g --start HEAD --end HEAD~3 
# would return the last 3 commits
</code></pre>
<p>And as you might have understood, commitlog does work with git's revision system
so you can reuse git's own revision pointers as needed. Though it's mostly
easier to just use the HASH since, finding the hashes in <code>git log</code> is easier
than finding the number you have to type after the <code>HEAD~</code></p>
<h4 id="from-a-different-repo">From a different repo</h4>
A lot more often you might need to generate logs for a sub-repo when working with a huge multirepo folder which a lot of sub-modules and switching worktree for the changelog might not be something you wish to do.
<p>In cases like these the <code>-p</code> or <code>--path</code> flag can be used with the <code>generate</code>
flag</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ commitlog g -p ./sub/module -s HEAD~3 
# would return the commits from HEAD~3 to the next tag or end of all commits.
</code></pre>
<h4 id="categorize">Categorize</h4>
You wouldn't be using commitlog otherwise so this obviously has to exist.
<p>As for why is this turned off by default? I just don't use commit standards and
mostly just need the commits between tags and very rarely need the categories to
help me but doesn't change the fact that someone else might need it.</p>
<p>So, how does commitlog categorize? using regex's , or more like comma seperated
regex's.</p>
<p>The implementation approach might bring some issue but I'm going to wait for
them instead of over fixing something that might never really happen.</p>
<p>Anyway, a simple example for a non-scoped commitlint styled categorization would
look something like this .</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ commitlog g --categories=&quot;feat:,fix:&quot;

<p>As visible, you find more commits in the 2nd one since the regex matches more
cases and gives you more information. You are free to modify these to make them
work with other patterns that you might follow.</p>
<p>Also the titles are going to be the regex's you pass. A future version will add
a way for you to add label's to the regex though that's a little harder to
achieve without making the flags very verbose so I've avoided it for now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is the initial implementation of this and might change in a
future major version since this flag feels a little more frictional than the
other approaches I have in mind. Feel free to recommend other ways to do this.</p>
