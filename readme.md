# Commitlog

Changelog generator using Commit History 

# UNDER DEV

it is usable by manualling installing the go package for now and isn't available as a binary right now, still under heavy development 

## Current Limitations 
- Cannot Specify a commit/tag to consider as the source of log 
- No Tests added so is probably unstable right now 
- Generates a huge markdown output of the whole repository from inception /initial commit

## Contribution 
You are free to raise PR's for any kind of improvements and or feature additions, they'll be added to the repository accordingly, you can also fork up your own version
